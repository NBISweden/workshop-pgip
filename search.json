    "text": "The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to commonly used methods in population genomics. As the focus of the course is on hands-on work, the topics have been designed to cover the fundamental analyses that are common in many population genomics studies. The course consists of lectures and exercises, with a focus on the practical aspects of analyses. Whereas lectures introduce some background theory, their primary aim is to set the stage for accompanying exercises.\n\nCovered topicsLearning objectivesRequirements\n\n\n\nFoundations of population genetics\nIntroduction to simulation and the coalescent\nBasics of variant calling\nVariant filtering and sequence masks\nCharacterization and intepretation of DNA sequence variation\nCalculation and interpretation of summary statistics from variation data\nInvestigating population structure with admixture modelling and principal component analyses\nDemographic modelling using sequentially Markovian coalescent models and linkage disequlibrium\nSelection scans\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to:\n\ndescribe the different forces of evolution and how they influence genetic variation\nunderstand and interpret genealogical trees and how they relate to genetic variation data\ndescribe the basics of the coalescent\nperform simple coalescent simulations with msprime\nrun simple SLiM forward simulation models\ndescribe and run the steps of a variant calling pipeline, including quality control of raw reads, read mapping, and variant calling\nknow how and when to filter raw variant calls using manual coverage filters\ndescribe and calculate nucleotide diversity from variation data\nanalyze population structure with admixture modelling and dimensionality reduction methods\nperform demographic modelling with sequential Markovian coalescent models\ndescribe methods that identify regions undergoing adaptation and selection\nrun selection scans, score identified regions and interpret findings in the context of genome annotations\n\n\n\n\nBasic knowledge in R or Python\nBasic knowledge of variant calling, or the equivalent of NBIS course “Introduction to Bioinformatics using NGS data”\nBasic knowledge of population genetics\nBasic understanding of frequentist statistics\nA computer\n\nDesirable:\n\nExperience with analysis of NGS and other omic data"
