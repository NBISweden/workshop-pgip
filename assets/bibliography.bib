  abstract = {We will soon have complete genome sequences from thousands of species. This coming explosion of information will transform our understanding of the amount, distribution and functional significance of genetic variation in natural populations.We identify those problems in conservation biology in which genomics will be most valuable in providing new insights and understanding. We also provide guidelines as to which new genomics approaches will be most appropriate for the different problems in conservation that can benefit from genetic analysis.The most straightforward contribution of genomics to conservation will be to enormously increase the precision and accuracy of estimation of crucial parameters that require neutral loci (for example, effective population size and migration rate).Genomic approaches can address important questions about the molecular basis and genetic architecture of inbreeding depression. Recent work indicates that the intensity of inbreeding depression can differ greatly depending on which specific individuals are founders. This suggests that the genetic load is unevenly spread among founder genomes and supports the notion that inbreeding depression sometimes results from major effects at a few loci.Anthropogenic challenges affect a wide range of species and habitats. Genomic approaches will allow the identification of adaptive genetic variation related to key traits for the response to climate change, such as phenology or drought tolerance, so that management may focus on maintaining adaptive genetic potential. The use of genomics to monitor genetic change caused by the harvesting of animals by humans could be extremely important because early detection of potentially harmful genetic change will maximize our ability to implement management to limit or reverse the effects before substantial or irreversible changes occur.Genomics provides exciting opportunities to assess differential rates of introgression across different genomic regions following hybridization between native and introduced species. The differential introgression rates of genomic regions raise some difficult issues with regards to treating hybridized populations in conservation and bring into question the efficacy of using a few (that is, ten or so) neutral markers to detect hybridization.Genomic tools will assist the management of ex situ populations and reintroductions by providing increased precision and accuracy of estimates of neutral population genetic parameters and by identifying specific loci of importance, which are essential for selecting select founder individuals.There is increasing evidence that epigenetic processes can be important following hybridization. Therefore, an epigenetics perspective might be important for understanding the effects of hybridization and predicting outbreeding depression.Improved basic scientific understanding through genomics will not necessarily lead to improved conservation. For example, understanding the relationship between genetic variation and fitness itself will not be sufficient to improve our estimates of population viability. Understanding the connections between individual fitness and population growth rates is perhaps the most important and difficult future challenge facing conservation genetics.},

Fully sequenced reference genomes were previously limited to model organisms and crop species, but can now be produced for any species, facilitating development of species-specific tools and sophisticated analyses. Next-generation sequencing can also quantify variation in gene expression, identify changes in DNA structure such as methylation involved in epigenetic responses, and characterize the multispecies metagenomics of communities and environments. While generating large genomic datasets has become much easier and faster, population genomic analyses now require stronger bioinformatic skills and more powerful computational resources.},

There remains a need for a simple, inexpensive platform that allows high-density SNP discovery and genotyping in large populations.

We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F2 individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

This review is meant as a rough guide for students and academics that want to start a domestication research project using modern genomic tools, as well as for researchers already conducting domestication studies that are interested in following a genomic approach and looking for alternate strategies (cheaper or more efficient) and future directions. We summarize the theoretical and technical background needed to carry out domestication genomics, starting from the acquisition of a reference genome and genome assembly, to the sampling design for population genomics, paleogenomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and experimental validation of domestication-related genes. We also describe some examples of the aforementioned approaches and the relevant discoveries they made to understand the domestication of the studied taxa.}

Because of this, a large number of specialized simulation programs have been developed, each filling a particular niche, but with largely overlapping functionality and a substantial duplication of effort. Here, we introduce msprime version 1.0, which efficiently implements ancestry and mutation simulations based on the succinct tree sequence data structure and the tskit library. We summarize msprime's many features, and show that its performance is excellent, often many times faster and more memory efficient than specialized alternatives. These high-performance features have been thoroughly tested and validated, and built using a collaborative, open source development model, which reduces duplication of effort and promotes software quality via community engagement.}

However, little is known about what determines its evolution, as most studies of mutation rates have focused on single species with different methodologies2. Here we quantify germline mutation rates across vertebrates by sequencing and comparing the high-coverage genomes of 151 parent\textendash offspring trios from 68 species of mammals, fishes, birds and reptiles. We show that the per-generation mutation rate varies among species by a factor of 40, with mutation rates being higher for males than~for females in mammals and birds, but not in reptiles and fishes. The generation time, age at maturity and species-level fecundity are the key life-history traits affecting this variation among species. Furthermore, species with higher long-term effective population sizes tend to have lower mutation rates per generation, providing support for the drift barrier hypothesis3. The exceptionally high yearly mutation rates of domesticated animals, which have been continually selected on fecundity traits including shorter generation times, further support the importance of generation time in the evolution of mutation rates. Overall, our comparative analysis of pedigree-based mutation rates provides ecological insights on the mutation rate evolution in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Measuring the magnitude of differentiation between populations based on genetic markers is commonplace in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. The predominant differentiation metric used for this purpose is FST. Based on a qualitative survey, numerical analyses, simulations, and empirical data, I here argue that FST does not express the relationship to allele frequency differentiation between populations generally considered interpretable and desirable by researchers. In particular, FST (1) has low sensitivity when population differentiation is weak, (2) is contingent on the minor allele frequency across the populations, (3) can be strongly affected by asymmetry in sample sizes, and (4) can differ greatly among the available estimators. Together, these features can complicate pattern recognition and interpretation in population genetic and genomic analysis, as illustrated by empirical examples, and overall compromise the comparability of population differentiation among markers and study systems. I argue that a simple differentiation metric displaying intuitive properties, the absolute allele frequency difference AFD, provides a valuable alternative to FST. I provide a general definition of AFD applicable to both bi- and multi-allelic markers and conclude by making recommendations on the sample sizes needed to achieve robust differentiation estimates using AFD.},

In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed\textemdash in some cases more than twofold\textemdash when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify these issues and propose solutions.},

  abstract = {Molecular population genetics aims to explain genetic variation and molecular evolution from population genetics principles. The field was born 50 years ago with the first measures of genetic variation in allozyme loci, continued with the nucleotide sequencing era, and is currently in the era of population genomics. During this period, molecular population genetics has been revolutionized by progress in data acquisition and theoretical developments. The conceptual elegance of the neutral theory of molecular evolution or the footprint carved by natural selection on the patterns of genetic variation are two examples of the vast number of inspiring findings of population genetics research. Since the inception of the field, Drosophila has been the prominent model species: molecular variation in populations was first described in Drosophila and most of the population genetics hypotheses were tested in Drosophila species. In this review, we describe the main concepts, methods, and landmarks of molecular population genetics, using the Drosophila model as a reference. We describe the different genetic data sets made available by advances in molecular technologies, and the theoretical developments fostered by these data. Finally, we review the results and new insights provided by the population genomics approach, and conclude by enumerating challenges and new lines of inquiry posed by increasingly large population scale sequence data.},

  abstract = {Estimating fine-scale recombination maps of Drosophila from population genomic data is a challenging problem, in particular because of the high background recombination rate. In this paper, a new computational method is developed to address this challenge. Through an extensive simulation study, it is demonstrated that the method allows more accurate inference, and exhibits greater robustness to the effects of natural selection and noise, compared to a well-used previous method developed for studying fine-scale recombination rate variation in the human genome. As an application, a genome-wide analysis of genetic variation data is performed for two Drosophila melanogaster populations, one from North America (Raleigh, USA) and the other from Africa (Gikongoro, Rwanda). It is shown that fine-scale recombination rate variation is widespread throughout the D. melanogaster genome, across all chromosomes and in both populations. At the fine-scale, a conservative, systematic search for evidence of recombination hotspots suggests the existence of a handful of putative hotspots each with at least a tenfold increase in intensity over the background rate. A wavelet analysis is carried out to compare the estimated recombination maps in the two populations and to quantify the extent to which recombination rates are conserved. In general, similarity is observed at very broad scales, but substantial differences are seen at fine scales. The average recombination rate of the X chromosome appears to be higher than that of the autosomes in both populations, and this pattern is much more pronounced in the African population than the North American population. The correlation between various genomic features\textemdash including recombination rates, diversity, divergence, GC content, gene content, and sequence quality\textemdash is examined using the wavelet analysis, and it is shown that the most notable difference between D. melanogaster and humans is in the correlation between recombination and diversity.},

  abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

In particular, the recombination rates of genomic regions correlate with their amount of within-population genetic variability, the degree to which the frequency distributions of DNA sequence variants differ from their neutral expectations, and the levels of adaptation of their functional components. We review the major population genetic processes that are thought to lead to these patterns, focusing on their effects on patterns of variability: selective sweeps, background selection, associative overdominance, and Hill\textendash Robertson interference among deleterious mutations. We emphasize the difficulties in distinguishing among the footprints of these processes and disentangling them from the effects of purely demographic factors such as population size changes. We also discuss how interactions between selective and demographic processes can significantly affect patterns of variability within genomes.}

The methods of evolutionary genetics are critically important for the analysis and interpretation of the massive datasets on DNA sequence variation and evolution that are becoming available, as well for our understanding of evolution in general. This book shows readers how models of the genetic processes involved in evolution are made (including natural selection, migration, mutation, and genetic drift in finite populations), and how the models are used to interpret classical and molecular genetic data. The material is intended for advanced level undergraduate courses in genetics and evolutionary biology, graduate students in evolutionary biology and human genetics, and researchers in related fields who wish to learn evolutionary genetics. The topics covered include genetic variation, DNA sequence variability and its measurement, the different types of natural selection and their effects (e.g. the maintenance of variation, directional selection, and adaptation), the interactions between selection and mutation or migration, the description and analysis of variation at multiple sites in the genome, genetic drift, and the effects of spatial structure. The final two chapters demonstrate how the theory illuminates our understanding of the evolution of breeding systems, sex ratios and life histories, and some aspects of genome evolution.},

However, this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc than those with small Nc and provides direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species.

One way of detecting constrained elements is to follow a bottom-up approach by computing constraint scores for individual positions of a multiple alignment and then defining constrained elements as segments of contiguous, highly scoring nucleotide positions. Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7\% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.},

Intraspecific variation, which includes the genomic and phenotypic diversity found within and among populations, is threatened by local extinctions, abundance declines, and anthropogenic selection. However, biodiversity assessments often fail to highlight this loss of diversity within species. We review the literature on how intraspecific variation supports critical ecological functions and nature's contributions to people (NCP). Results show that the main categories of NCP (material, non-material, and regulating) are supported by intraspecific variation. We highlight new strategies that are needed to further explore these connections and to make explicit the value of intraspecific variation for NCP. These strategies will require collaboration with local and Indigenous groups who possess critical knowledge on the relationships between intraspecific variation and ecosystem function. New genomic methods provide a promising set of tools to uncover hidden variation. Urgent action is needed to document, conserve, and restore the intraspecific variation that supports nature and people. Thus, we propose that the maintenance and restoration of intraspecific variation should be raised to a major global conservation objective.},

As expected, we found that each tool was the best in specific conditions. For Ion Torrent single-end RNA-Seq samples, the most suitable aligners were CLC and BWA-MEM, which reached the best results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, duplication rate, saturation profile and running time. About Illumina paired-end osteomyelitis transcriptomics data, instead, the best performer algorithm, together with the already cited CLC, resulted Novoalign, which excelled in accuracy and saturation analyses. Segemehl and DNASTAR performed the best on both DNA-Seq data, with Segemehl particularly suitable for exome data. In conclusion, our study could guide users in the selection of a suitable aligner based on genome and transcriptome characteristics. However, several other aspects, emerged from our work, should be considered in the evolution of alignment research area, such as the involvement of artificial intelligence to support cloud computing and mapping to multiple genomes.},

Our results clarify the relative impact of the two components on these statistics. We provide a rigorous interpretation of positive or negative values of an important class of neutrality tests in terms of the underlying tree shape. In particular, we show that values of Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H depend in a direct way on a peculiar measure of tree balance, which is mostly determined by the root balance of the tree. We present a new test for selection in the same class as Fay and Wu's H and discuss its interpretation and power. Finally, we determine the trees corresponding to extreme expected values of these neutrality tests and present formulas for these extreme values as a function of sample size and number of segregating sites.},

However, most efforts to model the response of species to climate change ignore intraspecific variation due to local adaptation. Here, we present a new perspective on spatial modelling of organism\textendash environment relationships that combines genomic data and community-level modelling to develop scenarios regarding the geographic distribution of genomic variation in response to environmental change. Rather than modelling species within communities, we use these techniques to model large numbers of loci across genomes. Using balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can accommodate nonlinear responses of loci to environmental gradients. We identify a threshold response to temperature in the circadian clock gene GIGANTEA-5 (GI5), suggesting that this gene has experienced strong local adaptation to temperature. We also demonstrate how these methods can map ecological adaptation from genomic data, including the identification of predicted differences in the genetic composition of populations under current and future climates. Community-level modelling of genomic variation represents an important advance in landscape genomics and spatial modelling of biodiversity that moves beyond species-level assessments of climate change vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).},

  abstract = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95\% confidence interval: 40-270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95\% c.i.: 17-43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95\% c.i.: 16.3-26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).},

This chapter describes the use of freely available software to align next generation sequencing reads to a reference and then to use the resulting alignments to call, annotate, view, and filter small sequence variants. The suggested variant calling workflow includes read alignment with novoalign, the removal of polymerase chain reaction duplicate sequences with samtools or bamUtils, and the detection of variants with Freebayes or bam2mpg software. ANNOVAR is then used to annotate the predicted variants using gene models, population frequencies, and predicted mutation severity, producing variant files which can be viewed and filtered with the variant display tool VarSifter.},

In particular, population genomics has provided key insights into ecological and evolutionary processes in natural and managed populations. These studies address a wide range of questions, including demography, phylogeny, genetics of ecologically relevant traits, and adaptation. They have also facilitated the conservation and management of biodiversity and harvested populations. Rather than exhaustively document the applications of population genomics in ecology and evolution, in this chapter we provide perspectives on a few key issues confronting researchers seeking to use population genomic tools in non-model systems. A wide variety of molecular and computational genomic approaches are available and have been used in ecological and evolutionary studies. There is no single best approach; rather, the genomic approach used should be tailored to best address the particular study goals and guided by the biology of the system. A large number of trade-offs, costs, and benefits distinguish genomic approaches, which we discuss below. To illustrate these issues, we focus on several published case studies and assess how the research questions were addressed.},

Existing data formats for quantitative genomics assays are, however, limited in either the analysis speeds they enable, the disk space they require or both. We have developed the dense depth data dump (D4) format and tool suite, with the goal of balancing improved analysis speeds with file size. The D4 format is adaptive in that it profiles a random sample of aligned sequence depth from the input sequence file to determine an optimal encoding that enables fast data access. We demonstrate that the D4 format offers substantial speed improvements over existing formats for random access, aggregation and summarization, while also achieving better or comparable file sizes. This performance enables scalable downstream analyses that would be otherwise difficult.},

  abstract = {The field of population genomics has grown rapidly in response to the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population genetic insights outpaced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous nonadaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Population genetic analyses often use summary statistics to describe patterns of genetic variation and provide insight into evolutionary processes. Among the most fundamental of these summary statistics are {$\pi$} and dXY, which are used to describe genetic diversity within and between populations, respectively. Here, we address a widespread issue in {$\pi$} and dXY calculation: systematic bias generated by missing data of various types. Many popular methods for calculating {$\pi$} and dXY operate on data encoded in the variant call format (VCF), which condenses genetic data by omitting invariant sites. When calculating {$\pi$} and dXY using a VCF, it is often implicitly assumed that missing genotypes (including those at sites not represented in the VCF) are homozygous for the reference allele. Here, we show how this assumption can result in substantial downward bias in estimates of {$\pi$} and dXY that is directly proportional to the amount of missing data. We discuss the pervasive nature and importance of this problem in population genetics, and introduce a user-friendly UNIX command line utility, pixy, that solves this problem via an algorithm that generates unbiased estimates of {$\pi$} and dXY in the face of missing data. We compare pixy to existing methods using both simulated and empirical data, and show that pixy alone produces unbiased estimates of {$\pi$} and dXY regardless of the form or amount of missing data. In summary, our software solves a long-standing problem in applied population genetics and highlights the importance of properly accounting for missing data in population genetic analyses.},

This dataset was used, together with fossil calibration, to create a nuclear DNA phylogeny and to reassess evolutionary divergence times among primate clades. We found within-species genetic diversity across families and geographic regions to be associated with climate and sociality, but not with extinction risk. Furthermore, mutation rates differ across species, potentially influenced by effective population sizes. Lastly, we identified extensive recurrence of missense mutations previously thought to be human specific. This study will open a wide range of research avenues for future primate genomic research.},

Currently, mutation rate is thought to vary many fold among genes within a genome and among lineages in mammals. We have conducted a computational analysis of 5,669 genes (17,208 sequences) from species representing major groups of placental mammals to characterize the extent of mutation rate differences among genes in a genome and among diverse mammalian lineages. We find that mutation rate is approximately constant per year and largely similar among genes. Similarity of mutation rates among lineages with vastly different generation lengths and physiological attributes points to a much greater contribution of replication-independent mutational processes to the overall mutation rate. Our results suggest that the average mammalian genome mutation rate is 2.2 \texttimes{} 10-9 per base pair per year, which provides further opportunities for estimating species and population divergence times by using molecular clocks.},

An nsSNP could potentially affect the function of the protein, subsequently altering the carrier's phenotype. This protocol describes the use of the 'Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant' (SIFT) algorithm in predicting whether an AAS affects protein function. To assess the effect of a substitution, SIFT assumes that important positions in a protein sequence have been conserved throughout evolution and therefore substitutions at these positions may affect protein function. Thus, by using sequence homology, SIFT predicts the effects of all possible substitutions at each position in the protein sequence. The protocol typically takes 5\textendash 20 min, depending on the input. SIFT is available as an online tool (http://sift-dna.org).},

  abstract = {Crosses between laboratory strains of mice provide a powerful way of detecting quantitative trait loci for complex traits related to human disease. Hundreds of these loci have been detected, but only a small number of the underlying causative genes have been identified. The main difficulty is the extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) in intercross progeny and the slow process of fine-scale mapping by traditional methods. Recently, new approaches have been introduced, such as association studies with inbred lines and multigenerational crosses. These approaches are very useful for interval reduction, but generally do not provide single-gene resolution because of strong LD extending over one to several megabases. Here, we investigate the genetic structure of a natural population of mice in Arizona to determine its suitability for fine-scale LD mapping and association studies. There are three main findings: (1) Arizona mice have a high level of genetic variation, which includes a large fraction of the sequence variation present in classical strains of laboratory mice; (2) they show clear evidence of local inbreeding but appear to lack stable population structure across the study area; and (3) LD decays with distance at a rate similar to human populations, which is considerably more rapid than in laboratory populations of mice. Strong associations in Arizona mice are limited primarily to markers less than 100 kb apart, which provides the possibility of fine-scale association mapping at the level of one or a few genes. Although other considerations, such as sample size requirements and marker discovery, are serious issues in the implementation of association studies, the genetic variation and LD results indicate that wild mice could provide a useful tool for identifying genes that cause variation in complex traits.},

However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. Results: We made 10 single nucleotide polymorphism and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10\textendash 15 kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100\textendash 200 kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

Various studies1,2,3,4,5 have found evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European populations, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size changes, we present a more detailed history of human population sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH)6, a Korean male (SJK)7, three European individuals (J. C. Venter8, NA12891 and NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507 (ref. 10) and NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very similar population-size histories before 10\textendash 20 kyr ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10\textendash 60 kyr ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago, possibly due to population substructure11. We also infer that the differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early as 100\textendash 120 kyr ago12, but considerable genetic exchanges may still have occurred until 20\textendash 40 kyr ago.},

One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36\texttimes{} coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25\% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07\% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6\% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98\% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97\% and 99.84\% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

However, with read depths too low to confidently call individual genotypes, lcWGS requires specialized analysis tools that explicitly account for genotype uncertainty. A growing number of such tools have become available, but it can be difficult to get an overview of what types of analyses can be performed reliably with lcWGS data, and how the distribution of sequencing effort between the number of samples analysed and per-sample sequencing depths affects inference accuracy. In this introductory guide to lcWGS, we first illustrate how the per-sample cost for lcWGS is now comparable to RAD-seq and Pool-seq in many systems. We then provide an overview of software packages that explicitly account for genotype uncertainty in different types of population genomic inference. Next, we use both simulated and empirical data to assess the accuracy of allele frequency, genetic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium estimation, detection of population structure, and selection scans under different sequencing strategies. Our results show that spreading a given amount of sequencing effort across more samples with lower depth per sample consistently improves the accuracy of most types of inference, with a few notable exceptions. Finally, we assess the potential for using imputation to bolster inference from lcWGS data in nonmodel species, and discuss current limitations and future perspectives for lcWGS-based population genomics research. With this overview, we hope to make lcWGS more approachable and stimulate its broader adoption.},

  abstract = {The R package pcadapt performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10\% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40\% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.},

By integrating the central observations from molecular biology and population genetics relevant to comparative genomics, Lynch shows why the details matter. Presented in a nontechnical fashion, at both the population-genetic and molecular-genetic levels, this book offers a unifying explanatory framework for how the peculiar architectural diversity of eukaryotic genomes and genes came to arise.

  abstract = {Our understanding of human population history in deep time has been assisted by fitting ``admixture graphs'' to data: models that specify the ordering of population splits and mixtures which is the only information needed to capture the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations. Not needing to specify population size changes, split times, or whether admixture events were sudden or drawn out simplifies the space of models that need to be searched. However, the space of possible admixture graphs relating populations is vast and cannot be sampled fully, and thus most published studies have identified fitting admixture graphs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the vast majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all admixture graphs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this findGraphs tool within a software package, ADMIXTOOLS 2, which is a reimplementation of the ADMIXTOOLS software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to admixture graphs that played key roles in eight published studies and find that graphs modeling more than six populations and two or three admixture events are often not unique, with many alternative models fitting nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from admixture graphs should only be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature, that fit the allele frequency correlation data, and that are not obviously wrong.},

  abstract = {Genotype calling plays important roles in population-genomic studies, which have been greatly accelerated by sequencing technologies. To take full advantage of the resultant information, we have developed maximum-likelihood (ML) methods for calling genotypes from high-throughput sequencing data. As the statistical uncertainties associated with sequencing data depend on depths of coverage, we have developed two types of genotype callers. One approach is appropriate for low-coverage sequencing data, and incorporates population-level information on genotype frequencies and error rates pre-estimated by an ML method. Performance evaluation using computer simulations and human data shows that the proposed framework yields less biased estimates of allele frequencies and more accurate genotype calls than current widely used methods. Another type of genotype caller applies to high-coverage sequencing data, requires no prior genotype-frequency estimates, and makes no assumption on the number of alleles at a polymorphic site. Using computer simulations, we determine the depth of coverage necessary to accurately characterize polymorphisms using this second method. We applied the proposed method to high-coverage (mean 18\texttimes ) sequencing data of 83 clones from a population of Daphnia pulex. The results show that the proposed method enables conservative and reasonably powerful detection of polymorphisms with arbitrary numbers of alleles. We have extended the proposed method to the analysis of genomic data for polyploid organisms, showing that calling accurate polyploid genotypes requires much higher coverage than diploid genotypes.},

The tree can reflect historical processes of splitting and divergence, but seeks to represent the actual genetic variance as accurately as possible with a tree structure. We generalise two major approaches to defining FST, via correlations and mismatch probabilities of sampled allele pairs, which measure shared and non-shared components of genetic variance. A diploid individual can be treated as a population of two gametes, which allows inference of coancestry coefficients for individuals as well as for populations, or a combination of the two. A simulation study illustrates that our fast method-of-moments estimation of FST values, simultaneously for multiple populations/individuals, gains statistical efficiency over pairwise approaches when the population structure is close to tree-like. We apply our approach to genome-wide genotypes from the 26 worldwide human populations of the 1000 Genomes Project. We first analyse at the population level, then a subset of individuals and in a final analysis we pool individuals from the more homogeneous populations. This flexible analysis approach gives advantages over traditional approaches to population structure/coancestry, including visual and quantitative assessments of long-standing questions about the relative magnitudes of within- and between-population genetic differences.},

  abstract = {The application of high-density polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers derived from high-throughput sequencing methods has heralded plenty of biological questions about the linkages of processes operating at micro- and macroevolutionary scales. However, the effects of SNP filtering practices on population genetic inference have received much less attention. By performing sensitivity analyses, we empirically investigated how decisions about the percentage of missing data (MD) and the minor allele frequency (MAF) set in bioinformatic processing of genomic data affect direct (i.e., parentage analysis) and indirect (i.e., fine-scale spatial genetic structure \textendash{} SGS) gene flow estimates. We focus specifically on these manifestations in small plant populations, and particularly, in the rare tropical plant species Dinizia jueirana-facao, where assumptions implicit to analytical procedures for accurate estimates of gene flow may not hold. Avoiding biases in dispersal estimates are essential given this species is facing extinction risks due to habitat loss, and so we also investigate the effects of forest fragmentation on the accuracy of dispersal estimates under different filtering criteria by testing for recent decrease in the scale of gene flow. Our sensitivity analyses demonstrate that gene flow estimates are robust to different setting of MAF (0.05\textendash 0.35) and MD (0\textendash 20\%). Comparing the direct and indirect estimates of dispersal, we find that contemporary estimates of gene dispersal distance ({$\sigma$}rt = 41.8 m) was {$\sim$} fourfold smaller than the historical estimates, supporting the hypothesis of a temporal shift in the scale of gene flow in D. jueirana-facao, which is consistent with predictions based on recent, dramatic forest fragmentation process. While we identified settings for filtering genomic data to avoid biases in gene flow estimates, we stress that there is no `rule of thumb' for bioinformatic filtering and that relying on default program settings is not advisable. Instead, we suggest that the approach implemented here be applied independently in each separate empirical study to confirm appropriate settings to obtain unbiased population genetics estimates.},

We also uncover a general ``phase change'' phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

A useful methodological framework for this purpose is F-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure and show how population substructure complicates inference. The results lead to simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for estimating population divergence.},

  abstract = {The expansion of agriculture is responsible for the mass conversion of biologically diverse natural environments into managed agroecosystems dominated by a handful of genetically homogeneous crop species. Agricultural ecosystems typically have very different abiotic and ecological conditions from those they replaced and create potential niches for those species that are able to exploit the abundant resources offered by crop plants. While there are well-studied examples of crop pests that have adapted into novel agricultural niches, the impact of agricultural intensification on the evolution of crop mutualists such as pollinators is poorly understood. We combined genealogical inference from genomic data with archaeological records to demonstrate that the Holocene demographic history of a wild specialist pollinator of Cucurbita (pumpkins, squashes, and gourds) has been profoundly impacted by the history of agricultural expansion in North America. Populations of the squash bee Eucera pruinosa experienced rapid growth in areas where agriculture intensified within the past 1,000 y, suggesting that the cultivation of Cucurbita in North America has increased the amount of floral resources available to these bees. In addition, we found that roughly 20\% of this bee species' genome shows signatures of recent selective sweeps. These signatures are overwhelmingly concentrated in populations from eastern North America where squash bees were historically able to colonize novel environments due to human cultivation of Cucurbita pepo and now exclusively inhabit agricultural niches. These results suggest that the widespread cultivation of crops can prompt adaptation in wild pollinators through the distinct ecological conditions imposed by agricultural environments.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

These challenges arise from difficulties in modelling the interactions between evolutionary processes and the similar ways different processes can impact genetic variation. Here, we describe how diversity and divergence between closely related species change with time, using correlations between landscapes of genetic variation as a tool to understand the interplay between evolutionary processes. We find strong correlations between landscapes of diversity and divergence in a well sampled set of great ape genomes. Through highly realistic, chromosome-scale, forward-in-time simulations we show that the observed great ape landscapes of diversity and divergence are too well correlated to be explained via strictly neutral processes alone. We describe how various processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, mutation rate variation, GCbiased gene conversion and selection could contribute to correlations. Our best fitting simulation includes both deleterious and beneficial mutations in functional portions of the genome, in which 10\% of fixations within those regions is driven by positive selection. Our results demonstrate that correlations between landscapes of genomic variation among closely related species can shed light on the complex balance of forces that have shaped genetic variation.},

Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. This paper describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.

  abstract = {When a selectively favourable gene substitution occurs in a population, changes in gene frequencies will occur at closely linked loci. In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (- Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

  abstract = {Speciation genomic studies aim to interpret patterns of genome-wide variation in light of the processes that give rise to new species. However, interpreting the genomic ``landscape'' of speciation is difficult, because many evolutionary processes can impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first chromosome-level assembly for the group, we use whole-genome sequencing and simulations to shed light on the processes that have shaped the genomic landscape during a radiation of monkeyflowers. After inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the 9 taxa in this radiation, we show that highly similar diversity ({$\pi$}) and differentiation (FST) landscapes have emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was strongly predicted by the local density of functional elements and the recombination rate, suggesting that the landscapes have been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the varying divergence times between pairs of taxa, we show that the correlations between FST and genome features arose almost immediately after a population split and have become stronger over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest that background selection (BGS; i.e., selection against deleterious mutations) alone is too subtle to generate the observed patterns, but scenarios that involve positive selection and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative explanations. Finally, tests for introgression among these taxa reveal widespread evidence of heterogeneous selection against gene flow during this radiation. Combined with previous evidence for adaptation in this system, we conclude that the correlation in FST among these taxa informs us about the processes contributing to adaptation and speciation during a rapid radiation.},

Here, we developed a method able to retroactively determine the error rate of most public sequencing datasets. To do this, we utilized the overlaps between reads that are a feature of many sequencing libraries. With this method, we surveyed 1943 different datasets from seven different sequencing instruments produced by Illumina. We show that among public datasets, the more expensive platforms like HiSeq and NovaSeq have a lower error rate and less variation. But we also discovered that there is great variation within each platform, with the accuracy of a sequencing experiment depending greatly on the experimenter. We show the importance of sequence context, especially the phenomenon where preceding bases bias the following bases toward the same identity. We also show the difference in patterns of sequence bias between instruments. Contrary to expectations based on the underlying chemistry, HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 share notable exceptions to the preceding-base bias. Our results demonstrate the importance of the specific circumstances of every sequencing experiment, and the importance of evaluating the quality of each one.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the genetic basis of adaptive population divergence is a goal of central importance in evolutionary biology. In principle, it should be possible to identify chromosomal regions involved in adaptive divergence by screening genome-wide patterns of DNA polymorphism to detect the locus-specific signature of positive directional selection. In the case of spatially separated populations that inhabit different environments or sympatric populations that exploit different ecological niches, it is possible to identify loci that underlie divergently selected traits by comparing relative levels of differentiation among large numbers of unlinked markers. In this review I first address the question of whether diversifying selection on polygenic traits can be expected to produce predictable patterns of allelic variation at the underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL), and whether the locus-specific effects of selection can be reliably detected against the genome-wide backdrop of stochastic variability. I then review different approaches that have been developed to identify loci involved in adaptive population divergence and I discuss the relative merits of model-based approaches that rely on assumptions about population structure vs. model-free approaches that are based on empirical distributions of summary statistics. Finally, I consider the evolutionary and functional insights that might be gained by conducting genome scans for loci involved in adaptive population divergence.},

Most knowledge spring from a small group of organisms and originate from before it was possible to generate genome-wide data on genetic variation. Hence, it is necessary to extend to a larger number of taxonomic groups, descriptive and hypothesis-based research aiming at understanding the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying both levels of genetic polymorphism and the efficiency of natural selection. In this study, we used data from 60 whole-genome resequenced individuals of three cryptic butterfly species (Leptidea sp.), together with novel gene annotation information and population recombination data. We characterized the overall prevalence of natural selection and investigated the effects of mutation and linked selection on regional variation in nucleotide diversity. Our analyses showed that genome-wide diversity and rate of adaptive substitutions were comparatively low, whereas nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism and substitution levels were comparatively high in Leptidea, suggesting small long-term effective population sizes. Still, negative selection on linked sites (background selection) has resulted in reduced nucleotide diversity in regions with relatively high gene density and low recombination rate. We also found a significant effect of mutation rate variation on levels of polymorphism. Finally, there were considerable population differences in levels of genetic diversity and pervasiveness of selection against slightly deleterious alleles, in line with expectations from differences in estimated effective population sizes.},

However, sampling across speciation events would, in many cases, require genomic time series that stretch well back into the Early Pleistocene subepoch. Although theoretical models suggest that DNA should survive on this timescale1, the oldest genomic data recovered so far are from a horse specimen dated to 780\textendash 560~thousand years ago2. Here we report the recovery of genome-wide data from three mammoth specimens dating to the Early and Middle Pleistocene subepochs, two of which are more than one million years old. We find that two distinct mammoth lineages were present in eastern Siberia during the Early Pleistocene. One of these lineages gave rise to the woolly mammoth and the other represents a previously unrecognized lineage that was ancestral to the first mammoths to colonize North America. Our analyses reveal that the Columbian mammoth of North America traces its ancestry to a Middle Pleistocene hybridization between these two lineages, with roughly equal admixture proportions. Finally, we show that the majority of protein-coding changes associated with cold adaptation in woolly mammoths were already present one million years ago. These findings highlight the potential of deep-time palaeogenomics to expand our understanding of speciation and long-term adaptive evolution.},

  abstract = {Few doubt that effective population size (Ne) is one of the most important parameters in evolutionary biology, but how many can say they really understand the concept? Ne is the evolutionary analog of the number of individuals (or adults) in the population, N. Whereas ecological consequences of population size depend on N, evolutionary consequences (rates of loss of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding; relative effectiveness of selection) depend on Ne. Formal definitions typically relate effective size to a key population genetic parameter, such as loss of heterozygosity or variance in allele frequency. However, for practical application to real populations, it is more useful to define Ne in terms of 3 demographic parameters: number of potential parents (adult N), and mean and variance in offspring number. Defined this way, Ne determines the rate of random genetic drift across the entire genome in the offspring generation. Other evolutionary forces (mutation, migration, selection)\textemdash together with factors such as variation in recombination rate\textemdash can also affect genetic variation, and this leads to heterogeneity across the genome in observed rates of genetic change. For some, it has been convenient to interpret this heterogeneity in terms of heterogeneity in Ne, but unfortunately, this has muddled the concepts of genetic drift and effective population size. A commonly repeated misconception is that Ne is the number of parents that actually contribute genes to the next generation (NP). In reality, NP can be smaller or larger than Ne, and the NP/Ne ratio depends on the sex ratio, the mean and variance in offspring number, and whether inbreeding or variance Ne is of interest.},

There is alarming evidence for global declines in insect species diversity, abundance, and biomass caused by anthropogenic drivers such as habitat degradation or loss, agricultural practices, climate change, and environmental pollution. This raises important concerns about human food security and ecosystem functionality and calls for more research to assess insect population trends and identify threatened species and the causes of declines to inform conservation strategies. Analysis of genetic diversity is a powerful tool to address these goals, but so far animal conservation genetics research has focused strongly on endangered vertebrates, devoting less attention to invertebrates, such as insects, that constitute most biodiversity. Insects' shorter generation times and larger population sizes likely necessitate different analytical methods and management strategies. The availability of high-quality reference genome assemblies enables population genomics to address several key issues. These include precise inference of past demographic fluctuations and recent declines, measurement of genetic load levels, delineation of evolutionarily significant units and cryptic species, and analysis of genetic adaptation to stressors. This enables identification of populations that are particularly vulnerable to future threats, considering their potential to adapt and evolve. We review the application of population genomics to insect conservation and the outlook for averting insect declines.},

  abstract = {The abundance of many species of bumblebees is declining and climate change is a major contributing factor. The distributions of bumblebees are shifting northwards to track suitable climates across continents. Some of the species that are most vulnerable inhabit the Arctic and have no possibility to move further north. An important indicator of the viability of animal populations is genetic diversity, which can be tracked over time by genetic monitoring to identify populations that are declining or at risk. Species of arctic bumblebees found in the Swedish mountains are considered high priority for inclusion in genetic monitoring due to the threats they face from climate change. In this report we use whole-genome sequencing to assess genetic variation in seven species of bumblebee that inhabit the Swedish mountains. Six of the species are restricted to arctic and mountain environments, whereas one is widespread throughout Europe. In total, we sequenced 333 samples of these species from across their ranges in Sweden. Estimates of effective population size (NE) predicted from levels of genetic variation vary between \textasciitilde 55,000 for the species with the most restricted high alpine distributions, to 200,000 for the more common mountain species, and 220,000 for the widespread species. Population fragmentation is generally very low or undetectable in Swedish mountains, suggesting an absence of barriers to gene flow between sub-populations. None of the species appear to be at immediate risk of negative genetic effects due to high levels of genetic drift. Reconstruction of historical fluctuations in NE indicate that the arctic specialist species Bombus hyperboreus has already experienced substantial population declines since the last ice age and we detected one highly inbred sample of this species, suggesting it may be particularly vulnerable. The ranges of all of the mountain bumblebee species are predicted to shrink drastically due to the effects of climate change. Future genetic monitoring would be a useful way to detect whether populations have been adversely affected by declines or fragmentation that could threaten their viability. The data presented here serves as an important first step towards future genetic monitoring programs for these species.},

  abstract = {The ancestral recombination graph is a structure that describes the joint genealogies of sampled DNA sequences along the genome. Recent computational methods have made impressive progress toward scalably estimating whole-genome genealogies. In addition to inferring the ancestral recombination graph, some of these methods can also provide ancestral recombination graphs sampled from a defined posterior distribution. Obtaining good samples of ancestral recombination graphs is crucial for quantifying statistical uncertainty and for estimating population genetic parameters such as effective population size, mutation rate, and allele age. Here, we use standard neutral coalescent simulations to benchmark the estimates of pairwise coalescence times from 3 popular ancestral recombination graph inference programs: ARGweaver, Relate, and tsinfer+tsdate. We compare (1) the true coalescence times to the inferred times at each locus; (2) the distribution of coalescence times across all loci to the expected exponential distribution; (3) whether the sampled coalescence times have the properties expected of a valid posterior distribution. We find that inferred coalescence times at each locus are most accurate in ARGweaver, and often more accurate in Relate than in tsinfer+tsdate. However, all 3 methods tend to overestimate small coalescence times and underestimate large ones. Lastly, the posterior distribution of ARGweaver is closer to the expected posterior distribution than Relate's, but this higher accuracy comes at a substantial trade-off in scalability. The best choice of method will depend on the number and length of input sequences and on the goal of downstream analyses, and we provide guidelines for the best practices.},
